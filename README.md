# 3D-Puzzle-Game
### What is this?
A short logic puzzle video game which is aimed at **teaching others about logic circuits**, while giving them **easy visual feedback**. In real life, before one can see any visual results, one must first learn how electroics work, voltage drops, Ohm's law and many other essential aspects which are rather overkill if you simply want to learn about **logic gates** from a computer science perspective.

### What is the objective?
The player must lead a lost electron through a computer by creating circuits to let the charges pass.
In doing so, you lead the electron back to its mother(board).
